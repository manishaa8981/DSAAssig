Question 1 (a)

You are a planner working on organizing a series of events in a row of n n. Each venue can be decorated with
one of the k available k. However, adjacent n should not have the same theme. The cost of decorating
each venue with a certain theme varies.
The costs of decorating each venue with a specific theme are represented by an n x k cost matrix. For example,
costs [0][0] represents the cost of decorating venue 0 with theme 0, and costs[1][2] represents the cost of
decorating venue 1 with theme 2. Your task is to find the minimum cost to decorate all the n while adhering
to the adjacency constraint.
For example, given the input costs = [[1, 5, 3], [2, 9, 4]], the minimum cost to decorate all the n is 5. One
possible arrangement is decorating venue 0 with theme 0 and venue 1 with theme 2, resulting in a minimum cost of
1 + 4 = 5. Alternatively, decorating venue 0 with theme 2 and venue 1 with theme 0 also yields a minimum cost of
3 + 2 = 5.
Write a function that takes the cost matrix as input and returns the minimum cost to decorate all the n while
satisfying the adjacency constraint.
Please note that the costs are positive integers.
Example: Input: [[1, 3, 2], [4, 6, 8], [3, 1, 5]] Output: 7
Explanation: Decorate venue 0 with theme 0, venue 1 with theme 1, and venue 2 with theme 0. Minimum cost: 1 +
6 + 1 = 7.
